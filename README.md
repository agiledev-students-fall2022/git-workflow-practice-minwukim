## Is it ok to let an image created by the AI win the award?
As written in the article by NYT's [An A.I.-Generated Picture Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html), Mr. Jason Allen  won the first place in Colorado State Fair’s annual art competition with a picture generated by an AI software. It has always been nothing more than a science fiction that, in the future, artificial intelligence and robots will substitute most of the human beings' jobs. However, it seems like it is happening now.


This event engenders an interesting and important philosophical question: is it valid to give the award to Mr.Allen? Well, my answer for this question is yes. This is actually a question answered by Marcel Duchamp's *Fountain*. Although the artist didn't craft that artifact, but it was Mr. Duchamp himself that made the choice to take porcelain urinal as the artwork. Same logic applies to the case of Mr.Allen. The artist never drew the image by himself, but at the end he decided to pick the image and submit it to the art competition. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with him getting all the credits of the award.
